# URL Removal Request for Google Search Console
# Generated on July 19, 2025

This file contains URLs that should be removed from Google's index due to being 
dynamically generated ad network files that provide no user value.

## URLs to Remove from Index:

### Ezoic-generated dynamic content:
- https://quantumtools.me/tardisrocinante/vitals.js*
- https://quantumtools.me/parsonsmalze/mulvane.js*
- https://quantumtools.me/detroitchicago/birmingham.js*
- https://quantumtools.me/detroitchicago/overlandpark.js*
- https://quantumtools.me/detroitchicago/reno.js*

## Pattern-based Removal Requests:
- Any URL containing: tardisrocinante/
- Any URL containing: parsonsmalze/
- Any URL containing: detroitchicago/
- Any URL with parameters: ?gcb=* or ?cb=*

## Prevention Measures Implemented:

1. **robots.txt** - Added disallow rules for these patterns
2. **.htaccess** - Added server-level blocking (returns 403 Forbidden)
3. **Meta robots** - Consider adding noindex to any remaining files

## Next Steps:
1. Submit removal requests in Google Search Console for existing indexed URLs
2. Monitor for new similar URLs appearing
3. Wait for next crawl cycle (typically 1-4 weeks)

## Technical Notes:
These URLs appear to be generated by Ezoic's ad optimization system and should not be indexed 
as they provide no content value and can negatively impact SEO performance.
